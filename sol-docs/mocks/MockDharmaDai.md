# [ðŸ”—](/contracts/mocks/MockDharmaDai.sol#L5) SafeMath

Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow checks.

Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow. This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.

`SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows.

Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.

## [ðŸ”—](/contracts/mocks/MockDharmaDai.sol#L142) `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`

See {IERC20-transferFrom}.

Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. This is not required by the EIP. See the note at the beginning of {ERC20}; Requirements:

- `sender` and `recipient` cannot be the zero address.

- `sender` must have a balance of at least `amount`.

- the caller must have allowance for `sender`'s tokens of at least `amount`.

### Returns

- `bool`

## [ðŸ”—](/contracts/mocks/MockDharmaDai.sol#L168) `increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue)`

Atomically increases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller.

This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for problems described in {IERC20-approve}.

Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance.

Requirements:

- `spender` cannot be the zero address.

### Parameters

- `spender`
- `addedValue`

### Returns

- `bool`

## [ðŸ”—](/contracts/mocks/MockDharmaDai.sol#L190) `decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue)`

Atomically decreases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller.

This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for problems described in {IERC20-approve}.

Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance.

Requirements:

- `spender` cannot be the zero address.

- `spender` must have allowance for the caller of at least `subtractedValue`.

### Parameters

- `spender`
- `subtractedValue`

### Returns

- `bool`

## [ðŸ”—](/contracts/mocks/MockDharmaDai.sol#L216) `name()`

Returns the name of the token.

### Returns

- `string`

## [ðŸ”—](/contracts/mocks/MockDharmaDai.sol#L223) `symbol()`

Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the name.

### Returns

- `string`

## [ðŸ”—](/contracts/mocks/MockDharmaDai.sol#L231) `decimals()`

Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.

For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should be displayed to a user as `5,05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).

Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses.

### Returns

- `uint8`
